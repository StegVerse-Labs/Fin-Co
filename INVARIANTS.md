# Fin-Co Economic Invariants

These invariants are binding from v1.0.0 forward.
They may not be weakened without a major version change.

---

## 1. Human Solvency
No human’s survival depends on uninterrupted economic growth.

---

## 2. Capital Entropy
Economic advantage that does not re-enter productive retooling decays over time.

---

## 3. Temporal Coherence
No actor may gain systemic advantage solely by operating faster than others.

---

## 4. Governance Legibility
All constraints, stalls, and interventions must be legible, auditable, and bounded.

---

## 5. Survival Separation
Essential goods are insulated from speculative markets.

---

## 6. Non-Extractive Agenthood
AI agents acting for humans are fiduciaries by default.

---

## 7. Irreversible Rights
Once granted, human protections may not be silently revoked.

---

## 8. No Profit From Harm
No actor may profit from systemic degradation of human solvency.

---

## 9. Cognitive Load Bound
Human-facing obligations must remain comprehensible.

---

## 10. Symmetric Kill Authority
Any entity that can halt markets can itself be halted.

---

## 11. No Undefined States
All edge cases must resolve conservatively in favor of human protection.

---

## 12. Graceful Decline (Guarded)

If the system must contract, it shall do so by reducing scope, speed, or ambition — 
not by increasing extraction, forced participation, or human precarity.

In situations that are materially unforeseeable at the time of ratification, 
a temporary deviation may be enacted only under Strict Governance Authority 
as defined below.

Such deviation must:
- Be explicitly declared as a Graceful Decline Exception (GDE)
- Include measurable harm justification
- Be time-bound with a non-renewable sunset clause
- Require dual-channel authorization (protocol + human quorum)
- Emit a public Governance Decision Record (GDR)
- Automatically trigger a post-event audit review
- Default to restoration of all protections upon sunset

No Graceful Decline Exception may:
- Permanently weaken Human Solvency
- Collapse Survival Separation
- Remove auditability
- Create undefined states
- Be renewed without a higher evidentiary threshold

Collapse of ambition is allowed.
Collapse of human dignity is not.
