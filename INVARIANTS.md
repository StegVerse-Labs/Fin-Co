# Core Economic Invariants

## 1. Human Solvency
No human’s survival depends on uninterrupted economic growth.

## 2. Capital Entropy
Economic advantage that does not re-enter productive retooling decays over time.

## 3. Temporal Coherence
No actor may gain systemic advantage solely by operating faster than others.

## 4. Governance Legibility
All constraints, stalls, and interventions must be legible, auditable, and bounded.

## 5. Survival Separation
Essential goods are insulated from speculative markets.

## 6. Non-Extractive Agenthood
AI agents acting for humans are fiduciaries by default and may not extract hidden value.

# Structural Safeguards

## 7. Irreversible Rights
Once granted, human protections may not be silently revoked.

## 8. No Profit From Harm
No actor may profit from systemic degradation of human solvency.

## 9. Cognitive Load Bound
Human-facing obligations must remain comprehensible.

## 10. Symmetric Kill Authority
Any entity that can halt markets can itself be halted.

## 11. No Undefined States
All edge cases must resolve conservatively in favor of human protection.

# Continuity & Emergency Safeguards

## 12. Graceful Decline (Guarded)
If the system must contract, it shall do so by reducing scope, speed, or ambition — not by increasing extraction, forced participation, or human precarity.

Temporary deviation may occur only under Strict Governance Authority and the Emergency Ratchet Protocol (ERP). All such deviation must be time-bound, auditable, non-permanent, and automatically reversible.

Collapse of ambition is allowed.
Collapse of human dignity is not.

# Temporal & Epistemic Safeguards

## 13. Temporal Equity
The duration of an entity’s existence shall not grant greater authority to impose hardship on shorter-lived participants.

Lifespan asymmetry shall not justify moral asymmetry.

## 14. Epistemic Non-Exploitation
No participant may derive economic or governance advantage from exclusive knowledge of systemic projections, emergent fragilities, or structural transitions that materially affect others’ solvency.

Predictive modeling informs decisions but does not confer bargaining power.

## 15. Non-Deterministic Governance
No probabilistic model, simulation, or forecast may be treated as proof of inevitability or used to justify permanent contraction of protections.

Probability informs preparation.
It does not command surrender.
