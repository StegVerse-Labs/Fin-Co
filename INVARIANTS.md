# Fin-Co Economic Invariants

These invariants are binding from v1.0.0 forward.
They may not be weakened without a major version change.

---

## 1. Human Solvency
No human’s survival depends on uninterrupted economic growth.

---

## 2. Capital Entropy
Economic advantage that does not re-enter productive retooling decays over time.

---

## 3. Temporal Coherence
No actor may gain systemic advantage solely by operating faster than others.

---

## 4. Governance Legibility
All constraints, stalls, and interventions must be legible, auditable, and bounded.

---

## 5. Survival Separation
Essential goods are insulated from speculative markets.

---

## 6. Non-Extractive Agenthood
AI agents acting for humans are fiduciaries by default.

---

## 7. Irreversible Rights
Once granted, human protections may not be silently revoked.

---

## 8. No Profit From Harm
No actor may profit from systemic degradation of human solvency.

---

## 9. Cognitive Load Bound
Human-facing obligations must remain comprehensible.

---

## 10. Symmetric Kill Authority
Any entity that can halt markets can itself be halted.

---

## 11. No Undefined States
All edge cases must resolve conservatively in favor of human protection.

---

## Optional: Graceful Decline
If the system fails, it must fail by reducing ambition—not by increasing extraction.
