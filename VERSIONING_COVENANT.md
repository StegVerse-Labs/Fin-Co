# Versioning Covenant — Fin-Co

This covenant prevents silent drift, opportunistic regression, and emergency capture.

Fin-Co versions are structural commitments, not cosmetic releases.

---

## Version Categories

### PATCH (x.y.z → x.y.z+1)
- Bug fixes
- Clarifications
- No invariant or governance change

### MINOR (x.y.z → x.y+1.0)
- Structural clarification
- Document reorganization
- Enforcement refinement
- No weakening of invariant content

### MAJOR (x.y.z → x+1.0.0)
Required if any change:
- Modifies invariant language
- Weakens protections
- Alters emergency constraints
- Changes governance authority thresholds
- Reduces auditability

If uncertain → it is MAJOR.

---

## Retroactive Protection

Protections granted under prior versions may not be retroactively revoked.

---

## Emergency Discipline

Graceful Decline Exception (GDE) is governed by the Emergency Ratchet Protocol (ERP).

No emergency deviation may:
- Permanently weaken Human Solvency
- Suspend Capital Entropy
- Remove auditability
- Create undefined states
- Become normalized without version review

---

## Drift Rule

Any cumulative change that materially alters lived experience requires version review.

Silent tuning is forbidden.

---

## Integrity Clause

If invariant protections are bypassed without version escalation,
the version label is invalidated.
