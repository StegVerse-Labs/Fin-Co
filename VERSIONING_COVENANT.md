StegVerse Versioning Covenant

(Binding from v1.0 forward)

Purpose

This covenant exists to prevent silent drift, opportunistic regression, and capture-by-emergency.

It defines what can, cannot, and must never change without an explicit version transition.

This document is as important as the code.

⸻

1. Semantic Versioning Meaning

StegVerse versions are moral + structural, not cosmetic.
	•	PATCH (x.y.z → x.y.z+1)
	•	Bug fixes
	•	Performance improvements
	•	No change to protections, invariants, or power distribution
	•	MINOR (x.y.z → x.y+1.0)
	•	New features
	•	New markets or agents
	•	Must strictly preserve all existing invariants
	•	MAJOR (x.y.z → x+1.0.0)
	•	Any change that alters:
	•	Human protections
	•	Market constraints
	•	Agent permissions
	•	Governance authority
	•	Invariant definitions

If you hesitate about which category applies → it’s MAJOR.

2. Changes That REQUIRE a Major Version

A major version is mandatory if ANY of the following occur:
	•	Human solvency conditions are weakened
	•	Survival rails interact with speculative rails in new ways
	•	AI agents gain broader autonomy or pricing authority
	•	Stall conditions are relaxed or extended
	•	Governance override paths are simplified
	•	Audit visibility is reduced
	•	Time buffers are shortened
	•	Any invariant is modified, merged, or removed

No exceptions. No urgency clause.

⸻

3. Changes That Are FORBIDDEN Without a Major Version

The following are explicitly prohibited under minor or patch releases:
	•	Silent tuning of economic parameters
	•	Redefining “essential goods”
	•	Reclassifying markets to avoid constraints
	•	Emergency exceptions that bypass invariants
	•	Retroactive rule changes
	•	“Temporary” measures without sunset logic
	•	Narrative-only justifications without metrics

If it changes lived experience, it changes the version.

⸻

4. Protections That Are Retroactively Immutable

Once granted, the following may not be removed retroactively:
	•	Access to survival rails
	•	Fiduciary constraints on agents
	•	Audit rights
	•	Appeal channels
	•	Protection against forced participation
	•	Protection against latency exploitation

Future versions may add constraints.
They may not revoke these for past participants.

⸻

5. Drift Detection Rule

Any cumulative change that:
	•	Would take more than one paragraph to explain,
	•	Or would surprise a reasonable participant,

automatically triggers a version review.

There is no such thing as “just tuning.”

⸻

6. Founder Irrelevance Clause

This system must remain valid even if:
	•	The original authors leave
	•	The maintainers are hostile
	•	The culture shifts
	•	Public opinion turns

No invariant relies on:
	•	Good intentions
	•	Moral superiority
	•	Vigilance
	•	Heroic leadership

Only on enforcement.

⸻

7. Failure Mode Commitment (Graceful Decline)

If StegVerse must shrink, it will do so by:
	•	Reducing scope
	•	Reducing speed
	•	Reducing ambition

It will never do so by:
	•	Increasing extraction
	•	Forcing participation
	•	Weakening human protections

Collapse is allowed. Dehumanization is not.

⸻

8. Ratification

This covenant is ratified at v1.0.0 and applies to all future versions.

Any violation invalidates the version label.
