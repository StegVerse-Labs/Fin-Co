StegVerse Economic Constitution

The StegVerse Economic Constitution

A coherence-preserving market architecture for humans and AI

Our Premise

Modern economies demand uninterrupted growth while treating human limits as defects.
That contradiction is no longer survivable.

StegVerse exists to prove a different claim:

Markets can grow without consuming the people inside them.

This requires rules that do not collapse under scale, intelligence, or time.

The Six Economic Invariants

1. Human Solvency

No human’s survival depends on uninterrupted economic growth.

Participation must never require debt, desperation, or speed.
Markets may stall. Humans must not.

⸻

2. Capital Entropy

Economic advantage that does not re-enter productive retooling decays over time.

Hoarded leverage is not neutral.
Capital must move, build, or fade.

⸻

3. Temporal Coherence

No actor may gain systemic advantage solely by operating faster than others.

Humans operate at human time.
AI absorbs volatility and speed.
Markets are buffered accordingly.

⸻

4. Governance Legibility

All constraints, stalls, and interventions must be legible, auditable, and bounded.

There are no permanent emergencies.
Every pause has a reason, a record, and an end.

⸻

5. Survival Separation

Essential goods are insulated from speculative markets.

Food, shelter, medicine, and access are not chips on a table.
Speculation is optional. Survival is not.

⸻

6. Non-Extractive Agenthood

AI agents acting for humans are fiduciaries by default.

They are constrained, auditable, revocable, and forbidden from coercion or hidden extraction.
