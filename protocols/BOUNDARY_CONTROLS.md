# Boundary Controls — Fin-Co

This document defines how Fin-Co interfaces with external economic systems.

Fin-Co is not isolated.
But protected rails must not be contaminated.

---

## I. Capital Identity Binding

Capital inside protected rails must be:

- Identity-bound
- Provenance-traceable
- Subject to entropy regardless of storage location

Capital exiting Fin-Co loses protected-rail privileges.

Re-entry requires:

- Entropy reconciliation
- Provenance verification
- Governance review if thresholds exceeded

Entropy is identity-bound, not location-bound.

---

## II. Export Degradation Rule

When assets leave Fin-Co:

- They lose survival-rail access.
- They lose margin eligibility inside Fin-Co.
- They lose privileged clearing status.

Re-entry does not restore privileges automatically.

---

## III. Derivative Isolation

Fin-Co protected-rail assets may not be:

- Used as collateral in external leveraged systems.
- Tokenized externally for margin trading.
- Referenced in synthetic leverage contracts without explicit governance approval.

Shadow leverage contamination is prohibited.

---

## IV. Essential Goods Shielding

Essential goods must:

- Maintain internal buffer reserves.
- Be insulated from external speculative pricing.
- Use smoothing mechanisms when external volatility exceeds threshold bands.

Survival Separation must remain materially enforceable, not symbolic.

---

## V. Predictive Containment

Simulation outputs may not:

- Automatically trigger market position changes.
- Grant timing advantage.
- Be used for speculative front-running.

Forecast-triggered governance actions must:
- Emit GDR
- Apply symmetrically
- Use buffered timing

---

## VI. External Capital Flight

If capital migrates externally:

- It forfeits protected-rail stability privileges.
- It cannot re-enter at advantage relative to internal participants.
- Entropy reconciliation applies on re-entry.

Privilege must not be portable.

---

## VII. Interpretive Rule

Fin-Co may interact with external systems,
but it may not import their volatility, leverage, or extraction logic into protected rails.
