Mission & Metrics Hierarchy

1. Purpose

This document defines the ordered hierarchy of objectives for Fin-Co.

It prevents:
	•	Mission creep
	•	GDP-maximization drift
	•	Coercive optimization
	•	Centralization through metric capture
	•	Ideological capture

Fin-Co is a resilience overlay.
It is not a macroeconomic governor.

⸻

2. Core Mission

Primary Objective

Universal Participation Enablement (UPE)

Enable all willing participants to:
	•	Access essential stability
	•	Engage in economic exchange
	•	Preserve agency
	•	Retain data ownership
	•	Withstand volatility shocks

Participation must remain voluntary.

No individual must surrender autonomy to survive.

⸻

3. Safety Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

These override all secondary goals.

3.1 Essential Preservation

The Essential Access Floor (EAF) must not collapse within system bounds.

3.2 No Coercion

No forced participation.
No identity-based penalties.
No behavioral scoring.

3.3 No Master Authority

No hidden override keys.
No unilateral freeze powers.
No secret intervention channels.

3.4 Bounded Damage

Systemic shocks must be dampened, not amplified.

3.5 Expiry Discipline

No permanent emergency states.

3.6 Identity Blindness

Adaptive responses must not target individuals.

If any safety constraint conflicts with secondary objectives, safety prevails.

⸻

4. Secondary Objectives (Permissible, Not Primary)

These may be pursued only if safety constraints remain intact.

4.1 Productivity Expansion (Deep GDP)

Fin-Co may contribute to GDP growth through:
	•	Reduced volatility loss
	•	Increased participation
	•	Reduced exclusion
	•	Improved coordination

It must not:
	•	Optimize GDP at the expense of autonomy
	•	Encourage extraction-based growth
	•	Incentivize fragility

⸻

4.2 Innovation Enablement

The system may:
	•	Support R&D participation
	•	Improve capital formation stability
	•	Enable long-horizon planning

It must not:
	•	Privilege specific entities
	•	Centralize funding decisions
	•	Suppress market competition

⸻

4.3 Education & Infrastructure Support

Fin-Co may:
	•	Provide visibility into access gaps
	•	Encourage distributed funding
	•	Reduce volatility for schools or services

It must not:
	•	Mandate allocation
	•	Centralize educational governance

⸻

5. Forbidden Optimizations

The following are explicitly prohibited as mission goals:
	•	Maximizing GDP at all costs
	•	Forced redistribution mechanisms
	•	Surveillance-based stability
	•	Identity-based economic control
	•	Permanent cartel protection
	•	System survival at the expense of invariants

If achieving a metric requires violating autonomy or invariants, the metric must be abandoned.

⸻

6. MVQL — Measurement Philosophy

Minimum Viable Quality of Life (MVQL) metrics are:
	•	Observational
	•	Privacy-preserving
	•	Aggregated
	•	Non-coercive
	•	Non-punitive

MVQL exists to:
	•	Identify systemic fragility
	•	Identify essential access gaps
	•	Measure volatility exposure
	•	Inform adaptive review

MVQL does not:
	•	Assign scores to individuals
	•	Restrict participation
	•	Enforce compliance
	•	Rank communities

Measurement is for transparency and learning, not control.

⸻

7. GDP Clarification

Fin-Co does not pursue GDP directly.

GDP may increase as a byproduct of:
	•	Broader participation
	•	Reduced collapse cycles
	•	Increased stability for innovation
	•	Reduced poverty-induced waste

If GDP growth requires violating safety constraints, it is rejected.

⸻

8. Poverty & Catastrophic Event Framing

Fin-Co does not claim to:
	•	Eliminate poverty globally
	•	Prevent all starvation
	•	Override geopolitical conflict
	•	Replace state institutions

It aims to:
	•	Reduce volatility-induced loss
	•	Preserve essential floors
	•	Expand participation
	•	Reduce fragility cascades

Outcomes remain dependent on external conditions.

⸻

9. Long-Horizon Species Consideration

If humanity seeks:
	•	Interplanetary survival
	•	Large-scale R&D
	•	Advanced coordination
	•	High surplus energy systems

Then reducing systemic fragility is prerequisite.

Fin-Co contributes by:
	•	Reducing collapse frequency
	•	Preserving participation capacity
	•	Encouraging decentralized resilience

It does not govern civilization.

⸻

10. Sunset Clause

If:
	•	Global poverty falls significantly
	•	Volatility declines structurally
	•	Essential access becomes universally stable
	•	Banking inclusion becomes near universal

Then Fin-Co must be reevaluated.

If no longer necessary, it may:
	•	Scale down
	•	Transition to archival mode
	•	Sunset gracefully

Permanence is not a mission goal.

⸻

11. Guiding Maxim

Fin-Co exists to:

Reduce volatility-induced human loss
while preserving autonomy
and expanding participation capacity.

It must never trade autonomy for optimization.
