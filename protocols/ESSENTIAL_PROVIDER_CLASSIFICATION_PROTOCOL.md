Version: v1.0.0
Status: Mandatory Security Boundary

⸻

1. Purpose

Defines how providers qualify, maintain, and lose “Essential Provider” status.

Essential classification is a security boundary, not a label.

It must resist:
	•	Cartel capture
	•	Political favoritism
	•	Volume concentration
	•	Fraud relabeling
	•	Permanent privilege

⸻

2. Essential Categories (Bounded)

Only the following categories qualify:
	•	Food & potable water
	•	Medical services & prescriptions
	•	Shelter / rent / basic housing
	•	Energy & heating/cooling
	•	Critical transportation to access above

Expansion requires:
	•	Major version increment
	•	Public review window
	•	Governance ratification

⸻

3. Qualification Mechanism

Essential status requires:

3.1 Multi-Party Attestation
	•	Minimum quorum of independent attestations
	•	Attestors cannot share controlling ownership
	•	Attestation must include service category

3.2 Epoch-Limited Status
	•	Status expires automatically after defined epoch duration
	•	Renewal required via fresh attestation
	•	No permanent classification

⸻

4. Concentration Safeguards

To prevent cartel capture:
	•	No single provider may exceed X% of essential-lane volume in a region
	•	If exceeded:
	•	Automatic review triggered
	•	New provider entry prioritized
	•	Essential renewal tightened

Concentration thresholds must be mechanical and pre-defined.

⸻

5. Anti-Relabeling Safeguards

Essential transactions must include:
	•	Category-tagged receipts (privacy-preserving)
	•	Standardized receipt proof format
	•	TTL-bound validation

Non-essential goods routed through essential lane are grounds for:
	•	Temporary declassification
	•	Automatic review
	•	Time-bound suspension

No permanent blacklisting without ratification.

⸻

6. Emergency Declassification

If fraud thresholds are exceeded:
	•	Temporary declassification may activate
	•	Duration must be predefined
	•	Review must begin immediately
	•	Auto-reinstatement unless ratified otherwise

No discretionary permanent removals.

⸻

7. Transparency

Public reporting includes:
	•	Aggregate essential-lane concentration bands
	•	Total number of active essential providers (banded)
	•	Renewal rates

No stable public provider list to prevent targeting.

⸻

8. Guiding Principle

Essential status is:

Time-bound.
Reviewable.
Diverse.
Non-concentrated.

It must never become a protected rent channel.
