DISPLACEMENT_SHOCK_MODE.md

File: protocols/DISPLACEMENT_SHOCK_MODE.md
Version: v1.0.0
Applies To: Fin-Co v1.5.0+
Status: Conditional Activation Protocol

⸻

1. Purpose

Displacement Shock Mode (DSM) defines how StegVerse systems respond to large-scale income volatility caused by:
	•	Automation acceleration
	•	Sector-wide layoffs
	•	Wage compression
	•	Credit contraction
	•	Policy-driven economic shifts
	•	Regional labor shocks

DSM exists to:

Preserve essential access.
Smooth short-term income disruption.
Prevent systemic cascade.

DSM is not a redistribution engine.
DSM is not political.
DSM is a temporary stabilizer.

⸻

2. Activation Triggers (Mechanical Only)

DSM may activate only when predefined, quantifiable thresholds are met.

Examples:
	•	Sustained increase in aggregate wage volatility index
	•	Community-level essential-lane demand spike above baseline band
	•	Backstop utilization velocity exceeding defined slope
	•	Sharp increase in pocket depletion within essential categories
	•	Settlement stress coinciding with essential demand increase

Triggers must be:
	•	Deterministic
	•	Identity-blind
	•	Predefined
	•	Publicly auditable

Narrative triggers are prohibited.

⸻

3. Stage 1 — Automatic Activation

Upon valid trigger detection, the system may automatically:
	•	Activate Income Gap Bridge (IGB)
	•	Reallocate defined percentage of community buffer toward essential stabilization
	•	Temporarily tighten non-essential multipliers
	•	Slightly increase vault→pocket slope protection
	•	Increase scam risk friction tiers

The system must not:
	•	Freeze custody
	•	Override user control
	•	Expand governance authority
	•	Modify entropy invariants
	•	Reduce Essential Access Floor

⸻

4. Income Gap Bridge (IGB)

4.1 Purpose

IGB provides temporary, capped essential liquidity support during verified income disruption.

It is not a wage replacement.
It is a continuity bridge.

⸻

4.2 Eligibility Logic (Mechanical)

Eligibility is determined by:
	•	Observable income variance relative to user’s historical volatility band
	•	Community-level displacement signal
	•	Essential-lane transaction patterns

No manual approval.
No identity profiling.
No credit scoring.

⸻

4.3 Bridge Constraints

IGB must be:
	•	Time-bound (e.g., 30–120 days max per activation cycle)
	•	Essential-lane restricted
	•	Capped per user per epoch
	•	Non-compounding
	•	Non-transferable
	•	Non-collateralizable

IGB cannot be used for speculation.
IGB cannot increase multiplier tiers.
IGB cannot affect governance weight.

⸻

5. Buffer Allocation

During DSM:
	•	A predefined percentage of community buffer may shift toward essential support.
	•	Global backstop may allocate capped stabilization support.

Buffer reallocation must:
	•	Remain within invariant bounds.
	•	Be fully logged.
	•	Auto-revert upon DSM expiration.

⸻

6. Essential Lane Priority

DSM strengthens, not weakens, essential access.

Rules:
	•	Essential lane remains uncapped below EAF.
	•	IGB applies only within essential lane.
	•	Essential providers retain settlement priority.
	•	No essential access may be suspended during DSM.

⸻

7. Anti-Abuse Safeguards

DSM must include:
	•	Essential category validation via multi-party attestation
	•	Rate-limited IGB disbursement
	•	Duplicate claim detection (mechanical)
	•	TTL-bound support windows
	•	Cross-epoch anomaly review

Abuse mitigation must never:
	•	Block legitimate essential payments
	•	Introduce manual approval bottlenecks
	•	Create permanent eligibility blacklists

⸻

8. Transparency Model

DSM follows staged transparency under ARP:
	1.	Internal activation log (immediate)
	2.	Public review announcement (within defined window)
	3.	Public summary after viability confirmation

User interface may display:

“Income stabilization guardrail active. Essentials protected. Review underway.”

No sensitive metric disclosure required.

⸻

9. Expiration

DSM must:
	•	Auto-expire after predefined duration
	•	Revert to baseline parameters
	•	Require fresh trigger to re-activate
	•	Require version increment for structural changes

No rolling emergency state permitted.

⸻

10. Learning Loop

After DSM expiration:

A public summary must include:
	•	Trigger category
	•	Duration
	•	Total IGB distributed (banded, not individual)
	•	Essential-lane stability metrics
	•	Lessons learned
	•	Proposed structural adjustments (if any)

Structural changes require formal ratification.

⸻

11. Non-Coercion Clause

DSM must not:
	•	Require user data sales
	•	Require political alignment
	•	Require behavioral scoring
	•	Require ideological agreement
	•	Grant authority to any single entity

Participation in StegVerse remains voluntary.

⸻

12. Alignment with Core Principles

DSM must preserve:
	•	Sovereignty
	•	Ephemerality
	•	Consent integrity
	•	Essential access guarantee
	•	Bounded damage
	•	Adaptive resilience
	•	No master override authority

⸻

13. Guiding Maxim

Volatility is expected.
Displacement is transitional.
Essentials must remain continuous.

The system absorbs shock so that families do not.
