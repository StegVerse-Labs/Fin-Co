Version: v1.0.0
Applies To: Fin-Co v1.5.0+
Depends On:
	•	ECONOMIC_CONSTITUTION.md
	•	EPHEMERALITY_PROFILE.md
	•	CONSENT_INTEGRITY_LAYER.md
	•	ESSENTIAL_ACCESS_GUARANTEE.md
	•	VERSIONING_COVENANT.md

Status: Mandatory Governance Constraint

⸻

1. Purpose

The Adaptive Resilience Protocol (ARP) governs how StegVerse systems:
	•	Automatically respond to systemic stress
	•	Publicly disclose review processes
	•	Ratify or reject structural changes
	•	Prevent silent authority drift

The system must:

Survive → Observe → Adapt → Revert or Harden

Without coercion.
Without permanent emergency states.
Without central override expansion.

⸻

2. Core Doctrine
	1.	Automatic responses must be mechanical.
	2.	Automatic responses must be identity-blind.
	3.	Automatic responses must be time-bound.
	4.	Automatic responses must auto-expire unless ratified.
	5.	Structural changes require formal version increments.
	6.	No emergency override may permanently expand authority.

⸻

3. Trigger Categories (Mechanical Only)

Automatic adaptation may activate only when predefined statistical thresholds are met.

Examples (non-exhaustive):
	•	Global reserve utilization velocity threshold
	•	Vault-to-pocket conversion anomaly
	•	Settlement failure rate threshold
	•	Nonce replay anomaly rate
	•	Fraud pattern density spike
	•	Essential lane abuse threshold

Triggers must be:
	•	Quantitative
	•	Deterministic
	•	Auditable
	•	Predefined in protocol

Triggers must never be:
	•	Narrative-based
	•	Politically motivated
	•	Identity-targeted
	•	Discretionary

⸻

4. Stage 1 — Automatic Activation

When a trigger condition is met:

The system MAY automatically:
	•	Reduce vault issuance slope
	•	Tighten multiplier temporarily
	•	Increase risk friction thresholds
	•	Tighten backstop draw caps
	•	Adjust settlement TTL windows
	•	Activate crisis-mode telemetry smoothing

The system MUST NOT:
	•	Freeze funds
	•	Seize custody
	•	Modify entropy bounds
	•	Introduce scoring systems
	•	Override essential access guarantees
	•	Introduce new authority roles

⸻

5. Activation Logging

Upon automatic activation:
	•	A protocol event MUST be logged.
	•	The log must be immutable.
	•	The log must be identity-blind.
	•	The log must include:
	•	Trigger category
	•	Timestamp
	•	Activated constraints
	•	Automatic expiry duration

This log exists even if public disclosure is staged.

⸻

6. Stage 2 — Public Review Announcement

Within a predefined maximum window (e.g., 24–72 hours):

A public notice MUST be issued stating:
	•	That adaptive guardrails activated
	•	Which trigger category was met (no sensitive data)
	•	That review has begun
	•	Expected review duration
	•	Confirmation that essential access remains protected

This announcement must avoid panic language.

It must be neutral and factual.

⸻

7. Stage 3 — Review Phase

During review:
	•	Human reviewers evaluate data
	•	AI entities perform simulation and impact modeling
	•	No structural changes occur automatically
	•	Temporary guardrails remain active
	•	All discussions must be logged

Review duration MUST be bounded (e.g., 7–14 days).

Review may conclude with:
	•	Reversion to baseline
	•	Minor structural adjustment
	•	Proposal for major version change

⸻

8. Stage 4 — Outcome Declaration

At review conclusion, a public outcome must be issued.

Possible outcomes:

A) Benign
	•	Guardrails revert
	•	No permanent changes

B) Minor Adjustment
	•	Parameters adjusted within existing bounds
	•	Minor version increment required

C) Structural Modification Proposal
	•	Requires major version increment
	•	Public review window required
	•	Ratification required per governance covenant

⸻

9. Automatic Expiry Rule

All automatic adaptations MUST:
	•	Expire after predefined duration
	•	Revert to baseline if not ratified
	•	Not self-extend automatically
	•	Require fresh trigger if reactivated

No rolling emergency states permitted.

⸻

10. Human + AI Review Constraints

Human reviewers:
	•	Must represent diverse perspectives
	•	Must not have unilateral authority

AI entities:
	•	Provide simulation outputs
	•	Provide statistical modeling
	•	Provide scenario analysis
	•	Must not vote or execute

AI remains advisory.

⸻

11. Transparency Timing Model

The system uses staged transparency:

Tier 1: Immediate internal activation log
Tier 2: Public review notice
Tier 3: Final outcome publication

User-facing interfaces may display:

“System guardrail active. Review underway.”

This must not expose sensitive metrics.

⸻

12. Prohibited Drift Mechanisms

The ARP must never allow:
	•	Introduction of master freeze keys
	•	Introduction of identity mapping shortcuts
	•	Permanent scoring systems
	•	Reputation-based liquidity privileges
	•	Emergency authority concentration
	•	Silent protocol parameter modification
	•	Permanent essential-lane alteration without major version change

Any such proposal requires:
	•	Major version increment
	•	Formal Governance Decision Record (GDR)
	•	Public review window
	•	Explicit sunset clause

⸻

13. Learning Loop Requirements

After each activation cycle:

A public summary must include:
	•	Trigger category
	•	Duration
	•	Impact scope
	•	Lessons learned
	•	Whether parameters changed

The goal is resilience learning, not control expansion.

⸻

14. Failure Philosophy

Malicious behavior is expected.
Human error is expected.
Panic is expected.

Systemic cascade is not acceptable.

Damage must be bounded.

If cascade occurs, structural caps were insufficient.

⸻

15. Alignment Statement

This protocol exists to ensure:
	•	Stability without coercion
	•	Adaptation without authority creep
	•	Transparency without panic amplification
	•	Learning without drift
	•	Resilience without control

The system must never sacrifice sovereignty in the name of stability.

⸻

16. Guiding Maxim

Automatic protection.
Public review.
Time-bound guardrails.
Human ratification.
No permanent emergency state.
