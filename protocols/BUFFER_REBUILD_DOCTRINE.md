1. Purpose

Prevents long-duration displacement from permanently depleting buffers.

Ensures DSM does not become structural dependency.

⸻

2. Rebuild Trigger

When buffer utilization exceeds predefined band:

System must enter Rebuild Mode upon DSM expiration.

⸻

3. Rebuild Mode Mechanics

During Rebuild Mode:
	•	Non-essential multipliers dampened
	•	Incentive payouts partially redirected to buffer
	•	IGB activation threshold tightened
	•	Vault slope normalization gradual

Rebuild Mode must:
	•	Be time-bound
	•	Be publicly logged
	•	Auto-expire after recovery band reached

⸻

4. Tapering Rule

If a user cohort receives repeated IGB activations:
	•	IGB window duration may taper unless severity increases
	•	Tapering must be mechanical
	•	Tapering must never reduce EAF

⸻

5. Supply-Side Incentives

Rebuild Mode may:
	•	Temporarily increase incentives for essential supply production
	•	Encourage new essential providers
	•	Incentivize local resilience capacity

This reduces future DSM load.

⸻

6. Backstop Integrity

Global backstop must:
	•	Maintain minimum reserve ratio
	•	Reject new IGB if reserve below floor (except EAF)
	•	Trigger emergency governance review if floor threatened

⸻

7. Guiding Principle

Stabilize first.
Rebuild second.
Expand third.

Support must never outpace sustainability.
