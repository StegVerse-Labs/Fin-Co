# Adversarial Assumptions

We assume:
- Actors may be profit-maximizing
- Actors may be hostile to human welfare
- Actors may be superintelligent
- Actors may attempt capture via legitimacy, complexity, or emergency

Fin-Co is designed so that:
- Exploitation leaves forensic traces
- Drift requires explicit versioning
- Harm-based profit is structurally blocked
