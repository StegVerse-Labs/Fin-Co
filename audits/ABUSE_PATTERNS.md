# Abuse Pattern Detection — Fin-Co

This document defines common extraction and manipulation patterns that audits must detect.

Audits exist to detect structural cruelty before it normalizes.

---

## I. Pump-and-Exit Pattern

Indicators:
- Concentrated early issuance
- Asymmetric liquidity unlocks
- Rapid early sell concentration
- Retail participation spike post-institutional exit

Response:
- Trigger GDR review
- Freeze further issuance
- Audit issuance schedule compliance

---

## II. Wash Flow Pattern

Indicators:
- Circular trading clusters
- Self-reinforcing liquidity loops
- Artificial volume inflation

Response:
- Flag accounts
- Suspend privilege tier
- Review provenance trails

---

## III. Crisis Gaming Pattern

Indicators:
- Profit concentration during GDE
- Asset accumulation prior to emergency invocation
- Repeated GDE proximity trading

Response:
- Mandatory audit escalation
- Entropy enforcement verification
- Governance quorum review

---

## IV. Forecast Front-Run Pattern

Indicators:
- Profit preceding forecast-triggered governance action
- Concentrated exposure to forecast-sensitive assets
- Repeated timing correlation

Response:
- Predictive Exploitation Flag
- Governance review
- Possible suspension from protected rails

---

## V. Complexity Shield Pattern

Indicators:
- Instruments exceeding cognitive load threshold
- Hidden fee structures
- Opaque derivative bundling

Response:
- Force simplification
- Restrict to speculative rail
- Require standardized disclosure

---

## VI. Authority-Profit Convergence

Indicators:
- Governance vote benefiting asset holder
- Emergency invocation followed by concentrated profit
- Issuance by governance participant

Response:
- Automatic recusal review
- COIP enforcement
- Public disclosure

---

## VII. Drift Normalization

Indicators:
- Repeated minor changes altering lived consequence
- Expanding emergency invocation frequency
- Gradual weakening of entropy effects

Response:
- Drift Detection Index escalation
- Mandatory version review consideration

## Audit Principle

When patterns emerge, assume structural vulnerability, not isolated anomaly.

Detection precedes enforcement.
Enforcement precedes drift.
