# Conflict of Interest Protocol (COIP)

This protocol prevents governance authority from converting rule influence into private economic advantage.

Fin-Co prohibits positional asymmetry from becoming extractive leverage.

This protocol applies to:
- Governance quorum members
- Protocol maintainers
- Audit authority
- Emergency Ratchet signatories
- Any participant with rule-modifying authority

---

## I. Role Tiers

### Tier 1 — Governance Authority
Participants who:
- Vote on invariant interpretation
- Approve GDE invocation
- Modify protocol constraints
- Sign GDR decisions

Restrictions:
- May not hold or issue tradable assets within protected rails.
- Must operate through Blind Trust Rail (BTR) if investment exposure exists.
- Must disclose all beneficial ownership structures annually.

---

### Tier 2 — Operational Authority
Participants who:
- Implement protocol changes
- Maintain infrastructure
- Access non-public telemetry

Restrictions:
- Asset exposure allowed but capped.
- Mandatory public disclosure of holdings in Fin-Co markets.
- Automatic recusal triggered by direct material exposure to decision scope.

---

### Tier 3 — Standard Participants
No additional COIP restrictions beyond invariant compliance.

---

## II. Blind Trust Rail (BTR)

Governance Authority participants must:

- Place investable assets into a Blind Trust Rail.
- Relinquish direct trading control.
- Prohibit communication with trust managers regarding active governance decisions.
- Accept entropy and privilege constraints like any other participant.

Violation invalidates governance eligibility.

---

## III. Recusal Logic

Automatic recusal required when:

- A decision directly impacts assets held.
- A close relative has material exposure.
- An affiliated entity has exposure exceeding 2% of relevant market.

Recusal must be recorded in GDR.

Failure to recuse invalidates vote.

---

## IV. Issuance Prohibition

Governance Authority participants may not:

- Launch tokens.
- Issue financial instruments.
- Benefit from new asset creation within Fin-Co.
- Directly receive revenue from speculative rail operations.

This includes meme-style tokenization schemes.

---

## V. Enforcement

Violations trigger:

1. Immediate suspension from governance.
2. Mandatory audit review.
3. Public disclosure.
4. Permanent ineligibility if intentional.

Conflict-of-interest violations are constitutional breaches.

---

## VI. Interpretive Rule

When ambiguity arises, governance must favor:

- Separation of authority and profit.
- Transparency over discretion.
- Recusal over participation.
