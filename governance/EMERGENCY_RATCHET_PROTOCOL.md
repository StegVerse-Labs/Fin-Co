# Emergency Ratchet Protocol (ERP)

The ERP governs all Graceful Decline Exceptions (GDE).

Emergency authority exists to stabilize unforeseeable systemic threats —
not to normalize extraction.

---

## Invocation Requirements

A GDE may only be invoked if:

1. The triggering condition was not reasonably foreseeable at ratification.
2. Human solvency is measurably threatened absent temporary deviation.
3. No invariant-compliant alternative exists.
4. Capital Entropy mechanisms remain active.

---

## Authorization Requirements

- Protocol-level trigger validation
- 2/3 human governance quorum
- Public Governance Decision Record (GDR)
- Maximum 90-day sunset
- Automatic audit scheduling

---

## Renewal Ratchet

Renewal requires:

- Demonstrable reduction in harm metrics
- 4/5 supermajority approval
- Independent audit summary
- Higher evidentiary threshold than initial invocation

No GDE may exceed 180 cumulative days without mandatory major version review.

---

## Prohibitions During GDE

- Suspension of Capital Entropy
- Expansion of speculative rail access to essentials
- AI-initiated emergency invocation
- Removal of audit logging
- Permanent protection weakening

---

## Minimal Emergency Record Fallback

If infrastructure is impaired, a cryptographically signed minimal emergency record must be emitted and expanded within 7 days.

---

## Restoration Rule

At sunset:
- All protections automatically restore.
- Post-event audit becomes mandatory.
- Findings are published.

Collapse of ambition is allowed.
Collapse of dignity is not.
