# Governance Policies — Fin-Co

Governance exists to preserve invariants under pressure.

---

## G-01: Temporal Parity
Protected markets may not reward latency advantage.

---

## G-02: Stall Legitimacy
Stalls must:
- Cite measurable trigger conditions
- Include sunset date
- Emit GDR

---

## G-03: Survival Rail Protection
Essential goods may not be collateralized or speculated upon.

---

## G-04: AI Fiduciary Mandate
AI agents must:
- Declare scope
- Remain revocable
- Disclose value flows
- Avoid hidden extraction

---

## G-05: Graceful Decline Exception (GDE)

GDE is governed by the Emergency Ratchet Protocol (ERP).

Invocation requires:
- Unforeseeable systemic threat
- Measurable solvency risk
- No invariant-compliant alternative

GDE must:
- Be time-bound
- Emit public GDR
- Trigger audit
- Preserve Capital Entropy
- Restore protections automatically at sunset

Emergency authority cannot become normalization authority.
