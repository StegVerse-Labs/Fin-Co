Scope

Applies to all StegVerse-governed markets, agents, and ledgers.

	•	Commit-reveal mechanisms
	•	Execution delegation via constrained agents

Violation:
Profit derived primarily from latency differentials.

⸻

## Policy G-02: Stall Legitimacy

Rule:
Production stalls may only occur when predefined triggers are met.

Valid Triggers (example):
	•	Supply chain failure indices
	•	Safety incident thresholds
	•	Energy scarcity bounds
	•	Essential-goods inflation breaches

Stall Requirements:
	•	Signed trigger record
	•	Sunset date
	•	Exit conditions

⸻

## Policy G-03: Survival Rail Protection

Rule:

instruments

## Policy G-05: Graceful Decline Exception (GDE)

A Graceful Decline Exception may only be invoked if:

1. The triggering condition was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of version ratification.
2. Human solvency is measurably threatened absent temporary deviation.
3. No alternative compliant pathway exists.

Authorization requires:
- Protocol-level trigger confirmation
- 2/3 human governance quorum
- Public GDR issuance
- Maximum 90-day sunset (non-renewable without supermajority 4/5 vote)
- Automatic audit at expiration

Failure to restore protections upon sunset invalidates the version label.
