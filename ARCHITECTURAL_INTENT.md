# Architectural Intent — Fin-Co

Fin-Co exists to define a financial system that can grow, stall, contract, and renew without collapsing human dignity.

It does not seek:
- Maximum efficiency
- Permanent growth
- Competitive dominance
- Optimization at any cost

It seeks coherence under asymmetry.

Fin-Co is built on the recognition that:

- Humans are finite.
- Intelligence may scale beyond human limits.
- Time and knowledge create positional asymmetries.
- Emergency powers historically drift.
- Abstraction tends to dominate lived consequence unless constrained.

The invariant framework exists to:

- Prevent extraction from becoming stabilization.
- Prevent prediction from becoming domination.
- Prevent time from becoming hierarchy.
- Prevent emergency from becoming permanence.
- Prevent systems from forgetting who they are for.

Fin-Co does not attempt to eliminate risk.
It attempts to eliminate structural cruelty.

If future maintainers must choose between:
- System optimization
- Or lived dignity

This architecture chooses lived dignity.

This document records intent so that future interpretation cannot drift silently.
