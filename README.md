# Fin-Co — Financial Coherence Architecture

**Fin-Co** is the canonical financial coherence specification for StegVerse.

This repository defines the non-negotiable invariant structure governing:

- Human solvency
- Capital entropy
- AI economic participation
- Market timing symmetry
- Emergency governance constraints
- Epistemic and temporal asymmetry limits
- Version discipline across time

Fin-Co is not an implementation.
It is not a currency.
It is not a market.

It is the **constitutional constraint layer** that all future financial systems claiming compatibility must obey.

## Status

- **Version:** v1.5.0
- **Codename:** Framework Consolidation
- **Stability:** Constitutional Baseline
- **Invariant Count:** 15 (Layered Framework)

This version consolidates all prior hardening iterations into a structured constitutional framework.  
No protections were weakened. No enforcement scope was reduced.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A coherence-preserving macroeconomic architecture
- A layered invariant framework
- A governance and protocol constraint specification
- A long-horizon financial constitution
- A protection against systemic drift, extraction, and fatalistic governance

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- A trading platform
- A speculative framework
- A growth-maximization system
- A currency issuance engine
- A predictive dominance model

Fin-Co does not optimize for efficiency at the expense of lived consequence.

# Constitutional Structure

Fin-Co operates under a layered invariant framework:

### I. Core Economic Invariants (1–6)
Human solvency, capital entropy, temporal coherence, survival separation, governance legibility, and non-extractive agenthood.

### II. Structural Safeguards (7–11)
Irreversible rights, no profit from harm, cognitive load bounds, symmetric kill authority, and no undefined states.

### III. Continuity & Emergency Safeguards (12)
Graceful Decline (Guarded) governed by the Emergency Ratchet Protocol (ERP).

### IV. Temporal & Epistemic Safeguards (13–15)
Temporal equity, epistemic non-exploitation, and non-deterministic governance.

## Foundational Orientation

Fin-Co recognizes that:

- Time and knowledge acquire meaning only through observers.
- Lived consequence outranks abstraction.
- Probability informs preparation — it does not command surrender.
- Collapse of ambition is allowed.
- Collapse of dignity is not.

## Core Documents

- `ECONOMIC_CONSTITUTION.md` — Layered constitutional framework
- `INVARIANTS.md` — Canonical invariant definitions (authoritative wording)
- `VERSIONING_COVENANT.md` — Version discipline and change governance
- `ARCHITECTURAL_INTENT.md` — Recorded design intent
- `governance/EMERGENCY_RATCHET_PROTOCOL.md` — Emergency drift prevention
- `governance/GDR_TEMPLATE.md` — Governance Decision Record format
- `protocols/PROTOCOL_REQUIREMENTS.md` — Enforcement-level constraints
- `audits/AUDIT_METRICS.md` — Drift detection and compliance telemetry

All implementations must conform to these documents.

---

## Version Discipline

Any modification to invariant content requires a **major version increment**.

Minor and patch releases may not weaken, reinterpret, or bypass invariant protections.

---

## Long-Term Intent

Fin-Co does not attempt to eliminate risk.  
It attempts to eliminate structural cruelty.

If future maintainers must choose between:
- System optimization
- Or lived dignity

This architecture chooses lived dignity.
