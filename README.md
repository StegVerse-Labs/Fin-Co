# Fin-Co — Financial Coherence Architecture

**Fin-Co** is the canonical financial coherence specification for StegVerse.

This repository defines the *non-negotiable rules* governing:
- Human solvency
- Capital behavior
- AI economic participation
- Market timing
- Governance legitimacy
- Version discipline

It is not an implementation.
It is not a currency.
It is not a market.

It is the **constraint layer** that all future financial systems must obey.
